I believe every aspect of this assignment has been correctly implemented, 
except handling both passengers and vehicles. I couldn't access the name of
"passengers" or "vehicles" from the object, so I had to assume that I was
always a vehicle.

I worked with Jorge for getting my location using geolocation.

I spent approximately 3-4 hours on this assignment.
