<h2>What is this purpose of this Git repository?</h2>
The purpose of this Git repository is that it shows my advancement through this class and the projects that I made. It can be used to show my Javascript and CSS skills to potential employers, as it is filled with practical assignments from the course.

<h2>What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?</h2>
I really enjoyed assignment 4, I wish to pursue web security a bit further next semester (taking 116 alongside 105) and I found it great how websites need to be tested for these vulnerabilities.

<h2>How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?</h2>
I think I will look at websites a lot differently from now on. I can look at the source code of web pages and actually understand how some cool HTML, Javascript and CSS tricks are made. I believe I have grown enough to look at the web a lot more critically.

<h2>What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.</h2>
I learned how to do my research and figure stuff out. Even though I have taken COMP40, COMP20 was a great opportunity to look up things I want to learn for this class, especially for the final project. I found the Responsive Design lab and the Captains Log labs very important for this, as I had to research my way into understanding them more deeply.

<h2>Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?</h2>
I want to dive more into web security. Thanks for an awesome semester!
